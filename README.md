# Dataset_for_Crash_Detection

We open-sourced part of our crash dataset that involved no privacy (from Internet and the CADP dataset). Moreover, this dataset is continuously being updated to support the research field of Crash Detection.

Welcome everyone to join and work together to make the world better！

### Simple Description

- The  dataset contains a total of **2694 crash videos**  that involved no privacy, primarily from the open-source dataset CADP and the Internet.
- This dataset and its corresponding paper were accepted by **《*IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS*》**
  - **Paper name :《An Appearance-Motion Network for Vision-based Crash Detection: Improving the Accuracy in Congested Traffic》**
  - If this paper is helpful to your research, please feel free to **cite** it!
